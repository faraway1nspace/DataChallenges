    "## Goal\n",
    "Pricing optimization is, non surprisingly, another area where data science can provide huge value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal here is to evaluate whether a pricing test running on the site has been successful. As always, you should focus on user segmentation and provide insights about segments who behave differently as well as any other insights you might find.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge Description\n",
    "Company XYZ sells a software for (39). Since revenue has been flat for some time, the VP of Product has decided to run a test increasing the price. She hopes that this would increase revenue. In the experiment, 66% of the users have seen the old price ( 39), while a random sample of 33% users a higher price ( 59).\n",
    "\n",
    "The test has been running for some time and the VP of Product is interested in understanding how it went and whether it would make sense to increase the price for all the users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Especially he asked you the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Should the company sell its software for  39 or  59?\n",
    "The VP of Product is interested in having a holistic view into user behavior, especially focusing on actionable insights that might increase conversion rate. What are your main findings looking at the data?\n",
    "The VP of Product feels that the test has been running for too long and he should have been able to get statistically significant results in a shorter time. Do you agree with her intuition? After how many days you would have stopped the test? Please, explain why.\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "We have two tables downloadable by clicking here. The two tables are:\n",
    "\n",
    "# \"test_results\" - data about the test\n",
    "Columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ user_id : the Id of the user. Can be joined to user_id in user_table\n",
    "+ timestamp : the date and time when the user hit for the first time company XYZ\n",
    "+ webpage. It is in user local time\n",
    "+ source : marketing channel that led to the user coming to the site. It can be:\n",
    "ads-[\"google\", \"facebook\", \"bing\", \"yahoo\", \"other\"]. That is, user coming from\n",
    "google ads, yahoo ads, etc.\n",
    "seo - [\"google\", \"facebook\", \"bing\", \"yahoo\", \"other\"]. That is, user coming from google search, yahoo, facebook, etc.\n",
    "friend_referral : user coming from a referral link of another user\n",
    "direct_traffic: user coming by directly typing the address of the site on the browser\n",
    "device : user device. Can be mobile or web\n",
    "operative_system : user operative system. Can be: \"windows\", \"linux\", \"mac\" for web, and \"android\", \"iOS\" for mobile. \"Other\" if it is none of the above\n",
    "test: whether the user was in the test (i.e. 1 -> higher price) or in control (0 -> old, lower price)\n",
    "price : the price the user sees. It should match test\n",
    "converted : whether the user converted (i.e. 1 -> bought the software) or not (0 -> left the site without buying it).\n",
    "\"user_table\" - Information about the user\n",
    "Columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "user_id : the Id of the user. Can be joined to user_id in test_results table\n",
    "city : the city where the user is located. Comes from the user ip address\n",
    "country : in which country the city is located\n",
    "lat : city latitude - should match user city\n",
    "long : city longitude - should match user city\n",
    "This challenge has been taken from the book \"A collection of Data Science Take-home Challenges\" by Giulio Palombo.\n",
    "\n",
    "## My Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, the manager needs to know: what is the probability that Revenue with a high-price ( 59) will be more than Revenue with a low-price ( 39). Different demographics of people may react differently to the different prices (e.g., poorer regions of the country versus wealthier). Therefore, we should try to explain the purchasing behaviour with individual-level data (what device they use, what part of the country USA are they from, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we can model people's purchasing behaviour, we can get an estimate of total revenue under high vs. low prices. That is easy with a predictive model. But, we also need an estimate of the uncertainty. \n",
    "Therefore, what we really want is a <b>probability distribution</b>: P(Revenue(Hi_Price) > Revenue(Low_Price) | the population of visitors)\n",
    "\n",
    "How to get his distribution? Through a combination of three aspects:\n",
    "+ <b>bootstrapping the data </b>: this allows me to get a frequency distribution (approximately Bayesian) for any estimate. What am I estimating?\n",
    "+ <b>predictive model</b> of shopper's purchasing behaviour\n",
    "+ use the my predictive model to evaluate two scenarios: what if EVERYONE had the cheap price (39), what if EVERYONE had the expensive price (59)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, this means\n",
    "+ loop through 1:B bootstraps and do:\n",
    "+ subset the data by the b (bootstrap)\n",
    "+ build a predictive model with the RESPONSE (Y) is whether or not the visitor made a purchase, and the features include: high price or low price; everything else (geography, device, etc...)\n",
    "+ use the predictive model to predict the Y is EVERYONE has price = low; the total revenue will be sum(Y_predicted*39).\n",
    "+ use the predictive model to predict the Y is EVERYONE has price = hi; the total revenue will be sum(Y_predicted*59).\n",
    "+ score I_b = revenue(hi) > revenue(low)\n",
    "+ after b bootstraps, we can approximate the probability P(Revenue(Hi_Price) > Revenue(Low_Price)) with mean(I_b)\n",
    "\n",
    "My predictive model will be a deep neural network. The interesting aspect about the neural network is the way I incorporate <b>geographic variation</b>. I will create an embedding of all the different towns/cities where people come from. This geographic variation will allow me to include WEALTH variation that is correlated with people's cities (for more information about the awesomeness of embedding layers, google word2vec or doc2vec or instacart)!!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features and Purchasing Behaviour\n",
    "Unfortunately, the deep-learning model makes it difficult to _interpret_ the model and which features were most important, given that there may be 2nd- or 3rd order interactions that cannot easily be visualized, except in marginal plots.  This is not unique to neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the embedding layer for 'city' does let learn relationships among American cities in terms of their purchasing behaviour. This could potentially allow the company to microtarget different cities. Embeddings can be visualized through a dimension-reduction method like t-SNE, and mined for a lot of rich information too."
