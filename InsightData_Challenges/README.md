# Insight DSNY Challenges

Welcome to the Insight Data Science challenges repo. 

Each week we'll be posting a new challenge (data science / coding / other).

Here are the instructions for accessing the repo files and pushing your submission:

1. If this is your first time here, you'll need to first clone the repo,
`$ git clone https://github.com/InsightTO/18C.git`.

2. Inside your local copy, `$ git pull`, to obtain most up-to-date files.

3. Navigate to the Challenge folder for the week for detailed instructions and supplementary files. For example, Week 5 challenge is located at `/DataChallenge1`.

4. When ready, place your submission in the `Submissions` sub-folder. **This should be the only folder you modify**.

5. `$ git add .`, to stage your files locally. Then `$ git commit -m "my commit message"` to commit.

6. Run a `$ git pull` one more time to make sure you're working on the most recent version of the repo, then `$ git push -u origin master` to push your local changes to the remote repo.

Have fun!
