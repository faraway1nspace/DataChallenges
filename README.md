# DataChallenges

Welcome!

This is a big repository of various data-science/machine-learning challenges, including:
+ [Breast Cancer](https://github.com/faraway1nspace/DataChallenges/tree/master/InsightData_Challenges/BreastCancer) diagnosis classification using XGBoost (from Insight Data)
+ [AB-testing](https://github.com/faraway1nspace/DataChallenges/blob/master/InsightData_Challenges/AB_testing/Robert_Rankin_DC2.ipynb) for revenue maximization using Deep Learning (from Insight Data)
+ [Australian dolphin species image classification (inspired by the FastAI DL1 course)

Some of these I may do a blog about, some of these were explicit projects which others may find interesting.
In general, they are a playground for deep-learning :)
