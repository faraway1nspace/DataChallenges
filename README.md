# DataChallenges

Welcome!

This is a mixed repository of various data-science/machine-learning challenges, including:
+ [Breast Cancer](https://github.com/faraway1nspace/DataChallenges/tree/master/InsightData_Challenges/BreastCancer) diagnosis classification using XGBoost (from Insight Data)
+ [AB-testing](https://github.com/faraway1nspace/DataChallenges/blob/master/InsightData_Challenges/AB_testing/Robert_Rankin_DC2.ipynb) for revenue maximization using Deep Learning (from Insight Data)
+ [Australian dolphin species](https://github.com/faraway1nspace/DataChallenges/tree/master/FastAi_Challenges/Dolphin_Classifier) image classification (inspired by the FastAI DL1 course)
+ [Employee Retension](https://github.com/faraway1nspace/DataChallenges/tree/master/InsightData_Challenges/EmployeeRetention) insights using boosted-survival analysis

Some of these may become a blog-post, some of these were explicit projects as part of a data-science fellowship. Being time-limited and constrained, such analyses wouldn't pass muster for an academic paper, but I thought others may find them interesting for their own applied work.
